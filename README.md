# About this repository

This repository contains examples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. In most cases, you won't see my name on the work because I served as a ghost writer for the subject-matter expert (SME) with whom I partnered. Speaking of which, the nature of my partnership with SMEs varies by project. Sometimes, the SME only provides the code and I write the rest of the content. Other times, the SME writes all the content, and I edit their work.
