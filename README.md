# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and task-based coding tutorials. 

After I was assigned to write these samples, I followed these steps:
1. Through Google Meet, I met with a subject-matter expert (SME), who provided the code and a high-level walkthrough of the topic at hand while I recorded the meeting. 
1. In Google Docs, I wrote the content based on the SME's code and the recording of the SME's walkthrough.
1. In the relevant environment, I tested the content. For example, I tested Core Web Vitals on a web page in Google Chrome.
1. I shared the content with the SME, an instructional designer, and a peer editor for review. 
1. If necessary, I addressed the reviewers' edits.
1. In Google's version-control system, I converted the content to a Markdown file, staged it, and shared it with all stakeholders for a final review. 
1. If necessary, I addressed any further feedback from the stakeholders.
1. I published the content.
