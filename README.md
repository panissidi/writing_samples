# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. For these samples, I partnered with subject-matter experts (SMEs) who provided the code and a high-level walkthrough of the topic at hand, and then I wrote and tested the content. I organized the samples into Markdown files by content type, and then further organized each file by product area.
