# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. 

After I was assigned to write these samples, the workflow followed these steps:
1. I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) who provided the code and a high-level walkthrough of the topic at hand through Google Meet. 
1. I wrote the content in Google Docs, and tested it in the relevant environment, such as Android Studio for Android content. 
1. I shared the content with the SME, an instructional designer, and a peer editor for review. 
1. If necessary, I addressed the reviewers' edits. 
1. I added the content to Google's version-control system, and shared it with all stakeholders for a final review. 
1. If necessary, I addressed any further feedback from the reviewers.
1. I published the content.
