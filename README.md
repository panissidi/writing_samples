# About this repository

This repository contains examples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. If a sample is in this repository, it means that I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) who provided the code and a high-level walkthrough of the topic at hand, but I wrote and tested the content. I linked to the samples in a Markdown files, one for blog posts and another for codelabs, each of which is organized by product area.
