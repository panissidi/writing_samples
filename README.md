# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing as indicated by the filenames. For example, the `tutorial_samples.md` file links to several task-based tutorials that I wrote at Google, while the `reference_samples.md` file links to my documentation of a fake REST API that I wrote for a self-paced online training.
