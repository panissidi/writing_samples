# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing. 

For writing assignments, I follow these steps:
1. I partner with a subject-matter expert (SME) from the relevant product area (PA).
1. I meet with the SME to learn how the technology works and obtain any necessary code samples.
1. I write the documentation based on the recording, insert the code samples where applicable, and perform a QA check.
1. I share the documentation with the SME and address any feedback from the SME until we both approve of the documentation. 
1. Either I or another member of my team stages and publishes the documentation through our internal content-management system (CMS).
