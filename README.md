# About this repository

This repository contains examples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. In most cases, you won't see my name on the work because I served as a ghost writer for the subject-matter expert (SME) with whom I partnered. Regardless, the SME provided the code, and I wrote the rest of the content.
