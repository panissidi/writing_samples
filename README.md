# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and task-based coding tutorials. 

For these writing samples, I followed these steps:
1. I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) from the product area (PA) at hand.
1. During a recorded video meeting, the SME walked me through their technology and provided any necessary code samples.
1. I wrote the documentation based on the recording, inserted the code samples where applicable, and tested everything to ensure that it worked.
1. I shared the documentation with the SME and addressed any feedback from the SME until we both approved. 
1. Either I or another member of my team staged and published the documentation through our content-management system (CMS).
