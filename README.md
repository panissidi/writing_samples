# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing for which I followed these steps: 
1. I partnered with a subject-matter expert (SME) from the relevant product area (PA).
1. I met with the SME to learn how the technology works and obtain any necessary code samples.
1. I wrote the documentation based on the recording, inserted any code samples where applicable, and performed a QA check.
1. I shared the documentation with the SME and addressed any feedback from the SME until we both approved of the documentation. 
1. Either I or another member of my team staged and published the documentation through our internal content-management system.
