# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing as indicated by the filenames. 

For example, the codelabs.md file links to several task-based tutorials that I wrote at Google, while the api_documentation.md file links to my documentation of a fake REST API that I documented as part of a self-paced online training that I completed.
