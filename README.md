# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and task-based coding tutorials. 

For writing assignments, I follow these steps:
1. I partner with a subject-matter expert (SME) from the PA at hand.
1. During a recorded video meeting, the SME walks me through their technology and provides any necessary code samples.
1. I write the documentation based on the recording, insert the code samples where applicable, and test everything to ensure that it works.
1. I share the documentation with the SME and address any feedback from the SME until we both approve. 
1. Either I or another member of my team stages and publishes the documentation through our content-management system (CMS).
