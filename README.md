# About this repository

This repository contains samples of my writing, including blog posts and codelabs, or task-based coding tutorials. For each of these samples, I partnered with a subject-matter experts (SME) who provided the code and a high-level walkthrough of the topic at hand, and then I wrote and tested the content.
